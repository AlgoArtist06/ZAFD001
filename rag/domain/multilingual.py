"""The multilingual answering layer: Hindi, Tamil, and Gujarati.

The product serves several Supported Languages over one English Source of Truth.
This module is the seam that lets it: it detects the user's language, extracts the
query's intent into an English string with legal terms preserved (so retrieval and
reasoning always run over the single English corpus), and renders critical terms
back into the user's language for the answer.

The Bilingual Legal Glossary is the deterministic backbone here: the same curated
table both normalises an incoming (or code-mixed) query to English and constrains
the terminology in the output, so a term like bailable versus non-bailable cannot
flip meaning in translation. The layer is data-driven by language code - adding a
language is adding a script row and a glossary column, not new branches - and it
flags terms whose translation lacks an official source, the known soft spot for
lower-resource languages like Tamil and Gujarati. The live intent extractor
(:class:`rag.infrastructure.llm.LLMIntentExtractor`) implements the protocol
below with the glossary terms injected as hard constraints; the product has no
offline extractor (ADR 0010) - tests inject their own doubles.
